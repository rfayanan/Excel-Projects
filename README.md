# Excel Projects

In the first project, I made an Excel report for treadmill sales at Fitness Equipment Inc. I created tables to reflect the yearly change in sales, revenue and exchange rates for each country they operated in. I also analyzed the impact of the fluctuations in exchange rates on revenue and created a chart to visualize that. 

In the second project, I was given a complex formula-based dashboard with bugs in the stucture that I troubleshot and resolved to fix the scoreboard.I have incuded both the faulty and the fixed scoreboards here.
